# Vehicle Detection And Counting using OpenCV

**Overview**

This project aims to design and implement a real-time vehicle detection and counting system using computer vision techniques. The system processes video streams from surveillance cameras to accurately detect and count vehicles, enhancing traffic management, safety, and environmental monitoring.

# How the Project Works

* A video stream is processed frame by frame.
* Detected vehicles are marked with bounding boxes.
* Vehicles crossing the region of interest (ROI) are counted and displayed on the interface.
* Outputs include a real-time vehicle counter and visual representation of traffic flow.
  
# Steps to Execute the Project

* Clone this repository to your local machine.
* Install the required libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt
* Run the Python script:
    python vehicle_counter.py --input video.mp4
